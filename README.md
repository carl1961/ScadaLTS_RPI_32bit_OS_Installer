When installing MariaDB Server, mysql_secure_installation

Just follow the prompts to set a password for the root user and to secure your MySQL installation.

For a more secure installation, you should answer “Y” to all prompts when asked to answer “Y” or “N“.

These prompts will remove features that allows someone to gain access to the server easier.

Make sure you write down the password you set during this process 

To access your Raspberry Pi’s MySQL server and start making changes to your databases, you can enter the following command.

####sudo mysql -u root -p

 You will be prompted to enter the password that you just created.
